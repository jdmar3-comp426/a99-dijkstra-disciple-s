At some point we need to create a "plan"

Understanding each file:

    Running the game
        - main.js = handles the functionality of the game: pipe generation, sprites, images, etc.
        - phaser.min.js = framework that the game runs on.

    HTML Webpages
        - index.html = main screen that allows users to choose: login, register, or play the game.
        - register.html = screen that allows users to create an account to track stats in game.
        - login.html = screen that allows registered users to login to the game.
        - game.html = screen where the actual game is played.

    CSS
        - style.css = style guide for all html pages. 

    Database
        - database.js = 
        - form.js = 
        - form2.js = 
        - server.js = 
        - user.db = 

    Assests
        - blockpipe.png = old pipe image (obsolete)
        - layerback.png = the clouds in the background
        - partyparrot.png = old player icon (obsolete)
        - rameses.png = player icon
        - stars.wav = audio that played... kinda annoying (obsolete)
        - tarheel_blockpipe_black.png = pipe image
        - tarheel_blockpipe_gold.png = pipe image
