# Running Rameses

Hey! Welcome to our project repository! If you're here, it's obiviously because you're itching to try our game. Well look no further. Here lies Running Rameses, a Flappy Bird knock-off. We wanted to revive the classic game, while also adding some school spirit to it. The game is simple: click the left mouse button or the space bar to JUMP. Jump your way between the pipes and see how far you can get. Think you can beat my all-time high score of 5?

## How to Play:

1) Create an account on the 'Register' screen
2) Login to your account on the 'Login' page
3) 'Play the Game' - 'space' or 'left-click' to JUMP... travers through the pipes to earn a score... 
4) Try and beat your high score!
5) Update account information on the 'Update' page
6) Delete account on the 'Delete' page OR logout of your account on the 'Logout page
