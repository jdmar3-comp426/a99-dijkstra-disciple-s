# Running Rameses

Hey! Welcome to our project repository! If you're here, it's obiviously because you're itching to try our game. Well look no further. Here lies Running Rameses, a Flappy Bird knock-off. We wanted to revive the classic game, while also adding some school spirit to it. The game is simple: click the left mouse button or the space bar to JUMP. Jump your way between the pipes and see how far you can get. Think you can beat my all-time high score of 5?
