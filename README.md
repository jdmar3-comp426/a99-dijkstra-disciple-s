# Running Rameses

Hey! Welcome to our project repository! If you're here, it's obiviously because you're itching to try our game. Well look no further. Here lies Running Rameses, a Flappy Bird knock-off. We wanted to revive the classic game, while also adding some school spirit to it. The game is simple: click the left mouse button or the space bar to JUMP. Jump your way between the pipes and see how far you can get. Think you can beat my all-time high score of 5?

## Check in with instructional staff

Once all the groups are together, we'll assign each group to an LA to check in with as you progress through the project.

We will post that so that your team can schedule a time for an initial check-in with your assigned LA. It would be a good idea also to add your LA to your repository.
